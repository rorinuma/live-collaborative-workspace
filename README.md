Live collaborative workspace

this is WIP, but the main idea is that there will exist a workspace that multiple users can work on, content would be updated through websockets, notifications, recent actions etc... 
also i'm thinking of adding a chat of a workspace, actions, todos and files upload (like pdf or something) but it's just a learning project, for tanstack queries, websockets,
scss, backend on typescript with postgresqlso, so the ambitions are not that big
