Live collaborative workspace

this is WIP, but the main idea is that there will exist a workspace that multiple users can work on, content would be updated through websockets, notifications, recent actions etc...
also i'm thinking of adding a chat of a workspace, actions, todos and files upload (like pdf or something) but it's just a learning project, for tanstack queries, websockets,
scss, redux, backend on typescript with postgresql, so the ambitions are not that big

oh yeah and I'm not saying what you need in order for this thing to work on your PC so good luck if you want to try it out.
